<p id="shoreline">You have found the shoreline.<br/>Congratulations.<br/><br/>
To your surprise, the shoreline isn't as abandoned as everything else in this godforsaken place and--weirdly enough--nothing has tried to kill you in the last few minutes...not that stuff has killed you yet, right? I mean, then you'd be dead and not here on the bustling shoreline.<br/><br/>
Your head is a mish-mash of memories mostly of things that you could not possibly have actually experienced. You chalk it up to the after effects of that tower...wait...what tower?<br/><br/>
You shake your head to clear the cobwebs<br/><br/>
There are a ton of native islanders (is that the right term? One hates to be accidentally offensive) moving back and forth between the water and a small camp they've appeared to set up for the purposes of processing some of the local resources. The women and children appear to be working exclusively in the camp, while most of the men seem to be packing the supplies onto several rather large, hand-crafted ships. The ones you're worried about, however, are the ones posted on the perimeter with the dangerous looking spears and machetes. They appear to be guarding...well, everything. While they might be okay with helping a stranger stumbling out over the hill and into their camp unexpectedly, they also might not and the guards would be the ones to be immediately worried about.<br/><br/>
It might be better to forgo the natives altogether and 'commandeer' a boat for your personal use. Yeah, they might take it badly, but what are the chances that they'd take the risk of sending out another of their valuable supply ships to chase the one you've taken? It's a risky path, but if you're going to be a pirate, be a pirate, yeah?<br/><br/>

You think you might be sailing in circles.<br/><br/> Days pass. Between the heat, lack of anything to eat or drink, and the stress of being lost in a sea of nothing, you start to hallucinate.<br/><br/> You wish you had some rum. A good pirate has rum, right? Or is it grog? After days of drifting aimlessly on the water in the unforgiving sun, anything would be great.<br/><br/>You hear a song coming from just below the water to your right and investigate. You find a beautiful mermaid beckoning you below the waves. In your sorry state, you think this is perfectly normal and slide off into the water to join your new friend.
