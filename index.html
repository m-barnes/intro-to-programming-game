<p id="cave">You wake up in a dimly lit cave.<br/><br/>
As your eyes slowly adjust to their surroundings you stand and take inventory.<br/><br/>
While you seem to have nothing in your possession, you are modestly covered in a t-shirt and shorts made--from what appears to be--a poly/cotton blend, which is nice, yeah? You also appear to have shoes...well, sandals of a sort. The left one seems a little worse as the strap securing it your foot dangles dangerously.<br/><br/>
Behind you is the dark, gaping maw of the interior of the cave. From the darkness there is a faint rumbling that rises over and through you. It seems to be growing louder and more violent with each passing moment. In front of you there is--what looks like--an opening in the rock. The light coming through the curtain of vines covering the other side indicates that outdoors lies that direction.<br/><br/>
You have a decision to make.<br/><br/>
