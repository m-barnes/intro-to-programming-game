<p id="outsideTower">You have found a rather tall, dark, and mysterious tower resting in a field of bright red flowers.<br/>You're not sure if congratulations are in order or not.<br/><br/>
The tower is tall. Looking up you notice the top is obscured by a thick layer of clouds. It just seems to go on forever. And it's dark. It's as if all color and light just disappears near it. You're not sure, but it seems to shimmer a bit depending on where your eyes hit it. In any event, it's one spooky place, yeah?<br/><br/>
At the front of the tower and at the end of a rather dilapidated cobble path, there is a huge crimson door. It seems to be in two parts with huge weathered handles made of what looks like wrought iron. Other than a faint marking in the wood that you can't quite make out, the door has nothing other to offer.
<br/><br/>
You could take your chances inside. Sure it's creepy, dark, and the deep rumbling coming from it makes it seem like it's humming a depressing dirge of sorts, but, comparatively, it's not that bad. You cannot deny that you are definitely drawn to it, but, again, you're not sure if that's a good or bad thing at this point.<br/><br/>
You could also turn around and run away. It is creepy, dark, and that humming really is quite unnerving. You're not sure what lies the other direction, but it can't be any worse than this, despite the unexplainable pull you feel from this thing.
<br/><br/>
