<p id="outsideCave">You are outside.<br/>Congratulations.<br/><br/>
As you step out into the light, the rumbling in the cave gets louder and more violent. With feet now on the hard packed earth of the forest, the cave collapses behind you, leaving only a thick plume of smoke and debris where the opening once was. Relief floods your body.<br/><br/>
Before you lies the remnants of a small--seemingly abandoned--campsite. It might, at one time, have been yours in the time before, but you cannot recall with any certainty.<br/><br/>
To your left is a dark and winding path through the forest. You have no idea what might lie past the tree line, but a sense of uneasiness comes over you if you think about it too long. <br/><br/>
To your right is wide open clearing. A field of what looks like red poppies stretches as far as the eye can see. The smell of salt on the air indicates you might be near a shoreline somewhere, but you can't see it from where your standing.<br/><br/>
Of course, there's always the campsite, right? It might be a good idea to rest for a minute. It would give you a moment to clear your head, find your bearings, and come up with a solid plan of attack for how to get out of this godforsaken place.<br/><br/>

Another decision lies before you. What do you do?<br/><br/>
