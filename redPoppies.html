<p id="outsideCave">You are in a field, surrounded by pretty red poppies.<br/>Congratulations.<br/><br/>
The flowers are pretty and smell super. They are certainly a nice change from that musty cave and hobo-smelling campsite from earlier. Tucked into the tall grasses, a gentle wind blows across the field causing everything it touches to sway gently. It wouldn't be so bad to hang out here for a while in the sun, would it? Eventually, you'll have to leave, but isn't there something about 'stopping to smell the roses?' You're sure that applies to poppies as well, right?<br/><br/>
On the breeze, however, is a fairly strong smell of salt, which means ocean, which might mean food...or people...or boats...or people with food and / or boats. Whatever the case, it might mean a way out, so, while sticking around in the field might be nice, it might be nicer to find some sailor with a spare bunk ready to ship out on high tide into the deep blue forever.<br/><br/>
While trying to come up with all the fancy nautical talk, you notice out of the corner of your eye a rather dark and mysterious tower that you're sure wasn't there before. It's tall, thin, and reaches far, far into the sky. While it looks like it might topple over at any minute, you get the impression that that is just an...impression.<br/><br/>
What is going on? The longer you stare at the tower that wasn't there, the fuzzier your head gets. At this point, you're not sure you could make it over there even if you wanted to.<br/><br/>
